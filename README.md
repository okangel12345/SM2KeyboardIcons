# Ultimate K&B Guide
I highly recommend you get a controller so you can beat certain areas of the game. PRE-MADE ICONS ARE AVAILABLE, just scroll down a little bit.
## Before you start:
 - Install and configure [ReWASD](https://github.com/EugeneSunrise/reWASD) to your liking.
 - Install [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) so you can see the DDS files at first glance. (Trust me, you'll need this)
 - Install [Java Runtime](https://www.java.com/es/).
 - Download Resorep (It's already included in the zip file so you can skip this).
 - Here's a video in case a step isn't very clear and you wanna see it being done: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/EQdKYTqf73I)
## Resorep Tutorial
 1. Extract "KeyboardIcons.7z", inside you'll find two folders.
 2. Move both folders to your game's directory where the launcher is: [example](https://i.imgur.com/vZ1KcqZ.png).
 3. Open "Resorep" and open the folder that corresponds to your OS.
 4. Open "resorep.jar", press "Add application" and select "Marvel's Spider-Man 2.exe" in your "workspace" folder.
 5. Then, click the three dots where it says "Modded textures folder:" and go to your game's directory (where you moved both folders) -> "KeyboardIcons" -> and select "Modded Textures".
 6.  Done. Now it's time to customize the mod.
 
 ## Icons Tutorial
 1. Copy and paste ALL the files from the folder "Textures for you to replace" to your "Modded Textures" folder. It should be looking like this: [example](https://i.imgur.com/REhgeEF.png).
 (P.s. left click in an empty space, go to "View" and select "Large Icons" so you can see the preview)
 2. In another explorer window, go to "KeyboardIcons" -> "K&M Icons" and there you'll find three different folders. *80x80 and 120x76* are the two different resolutions. *Colored and simple* are the two different styles, you can choose the style you'd like as long as it matches the resolution of the icon you are going to replace.
3. To replace, all you need to do is copy and paste the icon to your modded textures folder and rename it accordingly by removing the "#" symbol.
4. "But wait, how do I know which resolution icon should I use?" - It's easy. Is it a square? Use 80x80. Is it a rectangle? Use 120x76. THIS IS IMPORTANT, otherwise you'll have stretched textures.

I know it can be confusing at first so here's a quick example for you to follow: Let's say you mapped spacebar to act as the cross button in ReWASD. Firstly, you need to identify the cross button and it's resolution in the "Modded Textures" folder, in this case it's "#4294874960.dds" and it's a square. Then, you need to look for it in the icons. Simply copy and paste it into your "Modded Textures" folder and rename it so it matches the cross button but don't FORGET to remove the "#" symbol when you rename it. Then feel free to delete the original cross button file.
## Last Steps
After you've replaced all the icons, copy and paste ALL the icons from "Fixed Textures" to your "Modded Textures" folder. You don't need to modify those icons as those were already customized.

# Pre-made Icons
If you don't want the hassle of making your own config and icons you can download "SM2BakedIcons" in the [releases](https://github.com/okangel12345/SM2KeyboardIcons/tags) tab. There you'll find all the icons assigned to a pre-made ReWASD config made by Xyan. The guide is pretty much the same.
1. Extract "SM2BakedIcons.7z", inside you'll find two folders and a config.
 2. Move both folders to your game's directory where the launcher is: [example](https://i.imgur.com/vZ1KcqZ.png).
 3. Open "Resorep" and open the folder that corresponds to your OS.
 4. Open "resorep.jar", press "Add application" and select "Marvel's Spider-Man 2.exe" in your "workspace" folder.
 5. Then, click the three dots where it says "Modded textures folder:" and go to your game's directory (where you moved both folders) -> select "Modded Textures".
 6.  Install "SM2Config.rewasd" like any other config.
 7.  Done.

## Uninstall Process
DO NOT delete Resorep before properly removing the game first. Here are the steps you should follow:
1. Open Resorep and select your game's exe.
2.  Click "Remove selected"
3.  Done, now you can delete it.
