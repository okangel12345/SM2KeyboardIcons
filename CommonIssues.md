# Common Issues

## My game doesn't boot after installing the icons.
Set rendering mode to "DirectX 11" in the launcher settings. Vulkan is not compatible.

## Ctrl doesn't work.
Open ReWASD and remap "Ctrl" to act as "R". Then turn on keyboard controls on your launcher.
If that doesn't work simply use another key like "MB4", "R" or "F".
