# Common Issues

## My game doesn't boot after installing the icons.
Make sure you're running it on DirectX 11 in the launcher settings.

## Ctrl doesn't work.
Open ReWASD and remap "Ctrl" to act as "R". Then turn on keyboard controls on your launcher.
If that doesn't work simply use another key like "MB4", "R" or "F".
