# Common Issues

## My game doesn't boot after installing the icons.
There's not a fix for now, run "Uninstall_Keyboard_Icons.bat" to uninstall the icons.

## Ctrl doesn't work.
Open ReWASD and remap "Ctrl" = "R". Then turn on keyboard controls on your launcher.
If that doesn't work simply use another key like "MB4", "R" or "F".
