# Common Issues

## My icons look stretched.
When replacing the icons you need to check first whether the icon you're gonna replace is a **SQUARE** or a **RECTANGLE**.
- If it's a square replace using one of the icons from "80x80", it can be either colored or simple. It doesn't really matter.
- If it's a rectangle simply use one from "120x76".

*"But wait, how do I know whether it's a square or a rectangle?"* - Simply hover the mouse over the icon or select it and you should see the outline in the preview.

## Stuck in a puzzle?
Open the pause menu and choose the option to skip it.

## Resorep is crashing my game.
Seems that people who have it are missing files Resorep should've added when your game was added, absolutely no idea why this is happening. You can only verify a couple of things:
1. Make sure you have **64-bit Java** installed.
2. Verify you selected "Marvel's Spider-Man 2.exe" in Resorep.
3. Confirm that the version of Resorep you're using is the Windows 10 version.
4. Try removing your game in Resorep and then adding it again.

## My game's crashing and I want to remove Resorep.
**Method 1:** Assuming Resorep didn't work and you can't open your game, do the following:
- 1. Open Resorep and select your game.
- 2. Click "Remove selected"

 **Method 2:** If method one didn't work or you already deleted Resorep and can't remove your game because of that:
- 1. Open your "workspace" folder.
- 2. Search for "d3d11.dll"
-  3. Delete it. That's the injector and it shouldn't mess with your game anymore.
